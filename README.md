# LHD-Boulder-2018

These are my contributions to a team project at Local Hack Day in Boulder, CO, organized by HackCU.

My goal was to learn & use JavaScript, as I've had less-than-minimal exposure to that language.  We decided to build a webapp battleship game.  We used p5.js for the front-end.

My role was to create the canvas for the grid & register the mouse's location when the player clicks.
